- **Operational optimization**: Improving workflow and decision-making through structured data management.

## Features

- **Entity-Relationship Model**:
  - Comprehensive ER diagram outlining entities, attributes, and relationships.
  - Support for complex operations like multi-valued attributes, weak entities, and ternary relationships.

- **Entities**:
  - Customers, Orders, Meals, Tables, Waiters, Chefs, Delivery Drivers, Menu, HR, Administration, Suppliers, Ingredients, Emergency Contacts, Kitchen Stations, and Reviews.

- **Key Relationships**:
  - **Orders** are linked to customers, waiters, and meals.
  - **Meals** depend on ingredients supplied by suppliers.
  - **Reviews** connect customers to their dining experiences.
  - **Shift assignments** optimize employee scheduling.
