Phase 3:

- Creating Tables + constraints + ss  (code + table)			(Make sure to have all types of constraints learned so far)
- Filling tables with 10 rows each + ss (code +table)
- 10 COMPLEX Transactions + ss (code + table) 
- views for derived attributes + ss (code + table)
- 1 trigger, 1 function, 1 stored procedure + ss (code + table)
